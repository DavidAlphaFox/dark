# TODOs relating to Integration tests

LightTODO
Review the old Dark integration tests.
Is there anything like Analysis that we should replicate the testing efforts of?
Lots of editor-specific stuff, we have no need to replicate, but other things (e.g. Analysis) might be worth following up w/r/t testing, if they're not sufficiently covered elsewhere (i.e. in `backend` tests)

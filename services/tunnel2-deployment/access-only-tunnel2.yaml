# This is the network-policy for all services which run user code. The should be able
# to access the DB and the tunnel2 proxy, and nothing else.

# Note that this is not the network-policy for the tunnel2 proxy.

# We use 3rd party services, such as honeycomb, rollbar, and pusher. Those are fine
# to go through the proxy. They need to be configured to do so.

# In the future when we use more GCP services, we don't want them to go through the
# proxy, so we'll need to expand this a bit.

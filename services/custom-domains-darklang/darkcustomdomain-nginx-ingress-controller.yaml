# See docs/custom-domains.md for more detail.

# TODO: the complexity of the nginx-ingress plus cert-manager is quite something.
# Investigate caddyserver once it has a k8s ingress, or wait until gce-ingress
# supports more than 100 custom domains.
#
# This deployment runs nginx in order to terminate TLS for custom domains. It reads
# the domains from settings on the ingress and certificate data from k8s secrets
# (ending in "-tls").
#
# Docs: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/
#
# Note that in GCE, a TCP load balancer (currently
# a5457c33011e649d3800becd2b4f3291) points to this deployment and marks all the
# nodes except the ones running nginx as unhealthy. However, they're not
# actually unhealthy, it's just that there's (deliberately) not one
# pod-per-node and it doesn't know what to do with that.
#
# Note on headers:
#   We want to match the headers that gce-ingress has, so that there's not much
#   difference between custom-domains and regular builtwithdark.com. Unfortunately,
#   the default nginx template adds headers that are not removable via config,
#   including x-scheme, x-real-ip, x-forwarded-host, x-forwarded-port,
#   x-forwarded-scheme. I tried a ton of different ways to remove them, include lua
#   plugin, location-snippet with proxy_set_header, the proxySetHeaders setting, and
#   more_clear_headers. However, upon reading the template file it's clear that
#   there's very little flexibility over these headers, and that to remove them we
#   need actually edit the template.

# See docs/custom-domains.md for more detail.

# This deployment runs nginx in order to terminate TLS for custom domains. It
# reads the domains from secrets on the ingress.

# Note that in GCE, a TCP load balancer (currently
# ad1a603ffb59a4e5f8bde1e1a96c4a15) points to this deployment and marks all the
# nodes except the ones running nginx as unhealthy. However, they're not
# actually unhealthy, it's just that there's (deliberately) not one
# pod-per-node and it doesn't know what to do with that.

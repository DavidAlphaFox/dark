# DO NOT `kubectl apply` THIS FILE.
#
# This was the original version of the file. However, the file is a way to
# communicate to cert-manager, and we add to it using `kubectl patch` as part
# of scripts/custom-domains/add-to-cert-manager.
#
# As such, this file is only kept around as documentation for how we originally
# set this up, though we have also been updating it when we change the config
# (which we do manually and very carefully).

# See docs/custom-domains.md for more detail.

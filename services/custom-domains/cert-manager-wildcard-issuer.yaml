# Extra cert-manager issuer for wildcard domains on our own properties, like
# darklang.com, darksa.com, etc. For simplicity, the yaml files are here even
# though it's not really part of the custom-domain product.
#
# Each cert created here must be added to a gce load balancer via the
# `spec.tls` field of an ingress. The cert will be valid within 10 minutes, as
# that's how often the ingress updates its state (look for "scheduled to sync"
# in `kubectl get events`).
#
# Upon renewal, cert-manager will overwrite the secret with the new cert from
# letsencrypt. The load balancer will reread this secret on its next sync.

# honeycomb-agent is deployed via helm. I don't know a great deal about it, but it
# seems we can update the deployment with
#
# helm upgrade --install honeycomb honeycomb/honeycomb --values services/honeycomb-agent/config.yaml
#
# I think the regular config below also works
k8s:
  namespace: default
  manually-deployed:
    configs: []
    configmaps: { }
    # honeycomb-agent:
    #   text-file: config.yaml

    custom-post-apply:
      - kubectl rollout restart ds/honeycomb-agent

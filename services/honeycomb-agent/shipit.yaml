# honeycomb-agent is deployed via helm. I don't know a great deal about it, but it
# seems we can update the deployment or the config-file, with
#
# helm upgrade --install honeycomb honeycomb/honeycomb --values services/honeycomb-agent/config.yaml

    #  - kubectl rollout restart ds/honeycomb-agent

# Apiserver-service is in the darklang namespace, while the darklang ingress is in
# the default namespace. That means that the darklang ingress cannot reach the
# apiserver service. To solve this, we add this service in the default namespace
# which points to apiserver-service in the darklang namespace.
# CLEANUP This redirection thing does not actually work on a GKE ingress, and
# stackoverflow recommends using an nginx ingress instead if we want to do this. But
# it would be better just to combine everything into a single namespace instead.
# This is enabled for now. If we find another solution we can delete it.

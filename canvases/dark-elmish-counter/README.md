# Experiment: Test if GPT is able to generate 'Elmish Components' well

This is an incomplete experiment; hoping to revisit this later.

The theory here is that because components are pure+composable,
GPT will be able to generate/edit them well. I'm not sure if this is true, but I'd like to continue this at some point.

This 'canvas' was intended to be a minimal demo of what "components" might be in
Dark, while the `dark-elmish-editor` canvas was intended to be a more complex demo
involving components necessary for editing a Darklang canvas.

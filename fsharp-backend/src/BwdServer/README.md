# BwdServer

This is the webserver for builtwithdark.com, often referred to as "BWD."

All Dark programs are hosted with BWD - our grand-users hit this server, and BWD handles the requests.
So, BWD is what handles the "handlers" of a Dark program.

It uses ASP.NET directly, instead of a web framework, so we can tune the exact behaviour of headers and such.

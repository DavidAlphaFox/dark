# HttpMiddleware

HTTP Middleware modules to support BwdServer.

Designed to move as much of the HTTP framework into "user space"
(or something which could potentially be user space in the future)
as possible.

This library only exists so that we can separate LibBackendStdLib from LibBackend
does that^ comment (pull from fsproj) still make sense?

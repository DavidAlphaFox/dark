This library provides helper functions _specific to Darklang_, wrapping around the
bindings for [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) provided by
the adjacent `LibTreeSitter` project.

The `DarklangLanguage.cs` file is written manually, and `Generated.cs` file is a set
of helper functions generated by `./script/generate_tree-sitter_bindings.py`.

This isn't really used at all yet, and we may end up throwing this away

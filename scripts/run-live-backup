#!/usr/bin/env darklang

# This Dark script exists to:
# - back up all canvases and packages externally during deploy
# - after deploy, restore all canvases and packages from the most recent backup
# , while we have a temporary/unsafe 'live' environment.
#
# We do this as we'd like to not have to think hard about backwards compatibility
# at this point, while we focus on getting the new version of Dark (and its editor)
# out the door.
#
# The script is meant to be run via the Dark CLI like:
#
#   `./scripts/run-cli ./scripts/run-live-backup`
#
# TODO: Revisit this once the CLI has some updates. For now, playing with this functionality in dark-editor.

# Dark

This is the main repo for [Dark](https://darklang.com), a combined language, editor,
and infrastructure to make it easy to build backends and CLIs.

This repo is intended to help Dark users solve their needs by fixing bugs,
expanding features, or otherwise contributing. Dark is currently [source available, not
open source](https://github.com/darklang/dark/blob/main/LICENSE.md), but we are
actively pursuing making it open source.

Note that the production version of Darklang, "dark-classic", is not in this repo.
Since Feb 2023, the Darklang team has been working on a new version of Darklang,
which is in this repo -- temporarily, we're referring to this as "dark-next".
Dark-next isn't yet ready for production use.
